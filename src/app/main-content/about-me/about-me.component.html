            <h2>About me</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Hi! I'm a Front-end developer living in JÃ¼chen, Germany. I love to bring ideas and vison to life,
                    with precision and passion.
                    Coding grows continuously and I'm looking forward to continue growing with it, with a Junior
                    developer job position.
                </p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Developing is building, and I love it. Being it virtual or in real, I do my best to build
                            everything the best possible way and I feel always proud to see it grows and look at the final result.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>I have a lot of interests! Read, take a walk, playing games (board and video games), just
                            discuss about the world. I love activities making me thinking. I make sport and I'm always
                            happy to be with my family. And naturaly, I love coding!</p>
